- Safari
  - iOS 9: Emoji size doesn't change with font-size
  - iOS 7 - 8: The hamburger menu component doesn't use -webkit-transition when the menu initially loads, resulting in the menu being open by default. A workaround has been implemented to close the menu when the page loads on iOS 8 and under.

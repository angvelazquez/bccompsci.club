          <li>Fork the project's repository to your own GitHub account.</li>
          <li>Clone the forked repository to your computer.</li>

            Be sure to leave comments about your progress and status on the
            issue every few days while you're working on it! If you're stuck
            with something or need some more information, it's okay to ask for
            help or for clarification about the issue!

          <Alert variant="warning">
            The reason we ask that you provide updates about your issue every
            few days is to make sure that claimed issues are actively being
            worked on. If you do not provide any updates within a week, your
            issue may be unassigned from you and released for others to claim.
            There are other contributors that may have wanted to take the issue
            you claimed!

            Finally, once you're done, you can submit a pull request to merge
            your changes with the main branch!
          </h4>
          <li>Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.</li>
          <li>Open a pull request for your changes.</li>
        </div>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After you submit your pull request, a maintainer (or multiple!) will
        review your code. If all goes well and your pull request is accepted,
        your changes will be merged into the main branch!
      </p>
      <p>
        If things don't go as smoothly as they should, don't worry! Code
        reviewers will usually provide guidance about how you could fix any
        problems with your submission. Don't take it personally, as the
        maintainers are just trying their best to maintain the quality of the
        codebase. Don't be afraid to ask for help on the pull request if needed!
